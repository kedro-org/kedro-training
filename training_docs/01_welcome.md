## Before your training session

These training materials assume some level of technical understanding.

To optimise your experience and learn the most you can from the Kedro training, please review the following and then take a look at the [prerequisites page](./02_prerequisites.md) to get the necessary software, including Kedro, installed and running before your training session. 

## Prerequisite knowledge: Python, YAML and the CLI

-  You should be familiar with Python basics. [Take a look at this tutorial to confirm you are comfortable with](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/):

  - Functions, loops, conditional statements and IO operation
  - Common data structures including lists, dictionaries and tuples

- You should also:
  - Be able to [install Python packages using `pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/)
  - Understand the basics of [dependency management with `requirements.txt`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files)
  - Know about [Python modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) (e.g how to use `__init__.py` and relative and absolute imports)
  - Have [familiarity with Python data science libraries](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-10-python-libraries-for-data-science-cd82294ec266), especially `Pandas` and `scikit-learn`
  - Understand how to use [Jupyter Notebook/Lab](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) and [iPython](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-ipython))
  - Be able to [use a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) (we recommend using `conda`, but you can also use `venv` or `pipenv`)
  
- You should know [basic YAML syntax](https://yaml.org/)

- When working with the command line, you should be familiar with:
    
  -  `cd` to navigate directories
  -  `ls` to list files and directories
  -  [Executing a command and Python program from the command line](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/#how-to-run-python-scripts-using-the-command-line)


>**Note**: If you have any problems or questions, please contact an instructor before the training.
