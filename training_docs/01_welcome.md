## Before your training session

These training materials assume some level of technical understanding, such as knowledge of Python and use of a command line interface. To optimise your experience and learn the most you can from the Kedro training, please review the following and then take a look at the [prerequisites page](./02_prerequisites.md) to get the necessary software, including Kedro, installed and running before your training session. 

## Prerequisite knowledge: Python, YAML and the CLI

-  You should be familiar with Python basics. [Take a look at this tutorial to confirm you are comfortable with](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/):

  - Functions, loops, conditional statements and IO operation
  - Common data structures including lists, dictionaries and tuples

- You should also:
  - Be able to [install Python packages using `pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/)
  - Understand the basics of [dependency management with `requirements.txt`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files)
  - Know about [Python modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) (e.g how to use `__init__.py` and relative and absolute imports)
  - Have [familiarity with Python data science libraries](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-10-python-libraries-for-data-science-cd82294ec266), especially `Pandas` and `scikit-learn`
  - Understand how to use [Jupyter Notebook/Lab](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) and [iPython](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-ipython))
  - Be able to [use a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) (we recommend using `conda`, but you can also use `venv` or `pipenv`)
  
- You should know [basic YAML syntax](https://yaml.org/)

- When working with the command line, you should be familiar with:
    
  -  `cd` to navigate directories
  -  `ls` to list files and directories
  -  [Executing a command and Python program from the command line](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/#how-to-run-python-scripts-using-the-command-line)


>**Note**: If you have any problems or questions, please contact an instructor before the training.
