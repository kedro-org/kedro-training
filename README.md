This repository contains training materials that will teach you how to use [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/). This content is based on the standard [spaceflights tutorial described in the Kedro documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/03_tutorial/01_spaceflights_tutorial.html). 

The training documentation was most recently updated against Kedro 0.17.0 in February 2021.

To get started, navigate to the [training_docs](./training_docs/01_welcome.md) to see what is covered in the training, and how to ensure you get the most out of the time you set aside for it.
